# UNIT I: ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURE, FUNCTION, AND ENERGY FLOW

## 1.1 Defining Ecosystems: Beyond Simple Components

An ecosystem is fundamentally a **hierarchical, self-organizing system** that integrates living organisms with their physical environment into a functional unit. The term "ecosystem" encompasses multiple levels of organization:

### Hierarchical Organization:
- **Individual organisms** (cells → tissues → organs → organisms)
- **Populations** (groups of same species in same area)
- **Communities** (all populations in an area)
- **Ecosystems** (community + abiotic environment)
- **Biomes** (multiple similar ecosystems)
- **Biosphere** (all ecosystems combined)

Critically, the ecosystem concept emphasizes **functional integration**. A tropical rainforest ecosystem is not merely a collection of trees, animals, and soil—it is a system where energy flows through organisms following thermodynamic principles, nutrients cycle through biogeochemical pathways, and organisms interact through predation, competition, and mutualism.

### Key Ecosystem Properties:

**1. Heterotrophic vs. Autotrophic Balance:**
Every ecosystem contains both autotrophs (primarily plants) that fix energy and heterotrophs (animals and decomposers) that consume it. The **ratio of autotrophs to heterotrophs** fundamentally determines the ecosystem's productivity and carrying capacity. In a temperate forest, approximately 99.9% of biomass is autotrophic (plants), while only 0.1% is heterotrophic. Yet this tiny fraction of consumers fundamentally structures the entire ecosystem through top-down control.

**2. Trophic Complexity:**
Most ecosystems contain more than just producers and consumers. They include:
- **Primary producers** (Plants, photosynthetic bacteria)
- **Primary consumers** (Herbivores: grasshoppers, deer, zooplankton)
- **Secondary consumers** (Small carnivores: spiders, birds, small fish)
- **Tertiary consumers** (Apex predators: eagles, lions, sharks)
- **Omnivores** (consuming multiple trophic levels)
- **Detritivores** (consuming dead organic matter)
- **Decomposers** (breaking down organic molecules to inorganic forms)

This complexity is not arbitrary—it reflects evolutionary optimization and resource partitioning.

## 1.2 The Biotic Components: Detailed Analysis

### Producers (Autotrophs): Beyond "Plants"

Producers are organisms that synthesize organic compounds from inorganic precursors using external energy. While photosynthetic plants dominate terrestrial ecosystems, the full range of producers is broader:

**Photosynthetic Producers:**
- Vascular plants (trees, shrubs, grasses, herbs)
- Bryophytes (mosses)
- Algae (freshwater and marine)
- Cyanobacteria (prokaryotic photosynthesizers)
- Purple non-sulfur bacteria (facultative photosynthesizers)

**Chemosynthetic Producers:**
In deep-sea hydrothermal vents and some subsurface ecosystems, bacteria oxidize hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) or methane (CH₄) as energy sources, fixing CO₂ without light. These chemosynthetic ecosystems are entirely independent of solar energy—a paradigm-shifting discovery that expanded our conception of where life can flourish.

### Consumers: The Complexity of Feeding Strategies

**Primary Consumers (Herbivores):**
These organisms consume producers and are remarkably diverse. They range from:
- Zooplankton (consuming phytoplankton in aquatic ecosystems)
- Insects (constituting 75% of all animal species on Earth)
- Mammals (deer, rodents, elephants)
- Fish (many herbivorous species)

Each herbivore has evolved specific adaptations: ruminant stomachs for fermenting plant material, grinding molars for processing seeds, long digestive tracts for extracting nutrients from cellulose-rich plants.

**Secondary Consumers (Carnivores):**
Small carnivores feed on primary consumers. Examples include insectivorous birds, spiders, and small predatory fish. Importantly, secondary consumers **often exhibit less specialization than primary consumers**. A bird might consume grasshoppers, caterpillars, and seeds depending on availability—a generalist strategy that provides flexibility when prey becomes scarce.

**Tertiary Consumers (Apex Predators):**
Top predators exert **disproportionate influence** on ecosystem structure despite their small numbers. This concept—called **"trophic cascades"**—was dramatically demonstrated in Yellowstone National Park. When wolves were reintroduced, their predation on elk indirectly benefited vegetation, which stabilized riverbanks, which allowed beavers to thrive, which created wetland habitat that supported songbirds. A single apex predator reverberated through the entire ecosystem.

**Omnivores:**
Organisms consuming multiple trophic levels (humans, bears, rats, cockroaches) occupy a unique position. Their omnivory provides dietary flexibility during resource scarcity but often makes them less specialized and therefore less efficient at any single trophic level compared to specialists.

### Decomposers: The Recyclers

Decomposers—primarily bacteria, fungi, and some insects—perform the ecosystem's critical cleanup function. Without decomposition, dead organic matter would accumulate, ecosystems would become buried, and nutrients would remain locked in dead organisms, unavailable for new growth.

**The Decomposition Process:**
1. **Fragmentation:** Physical breakdown by detritivores (earthworms, millipedes, termites)
2. **Leaching:** Water-soluble compounds dissolving into soil
3. **Chemical decomposition:** Extracellular enzymatic breakdown of complex molecules
4. **Microbial decomposition:** Bacterial and fungal colonization and catabolism

Decomposition rates depend on:
- **Temperature:** Warm temperatures accelerate enzymatic reactions; tropical decomposition is 5-10× faster than in boreal forests
- **Moisture:** Anaerobic conditions in wet environments slow decomposition but preserve organic matter (leading to peat formation)
- **Substrate quality:** Nitrogen-rich material (animal waste) decomposes faster than carbon-rich material (wood)
- **Microbial community:** Different microbial communities have different decomposition capabilities

In tropical rainforests, decomposition is so rapid that organic matter barely accumulates—a paradox given the forest's immense productivity. The nutrients cycle quickly from plant to soil to plant, with relatively little storage in the system. In contrast, boreal forests accumulate thick layers of partially decomposed material (mor) due to slow microbial activity in cold conditions.

## 1.3 Abiotic Components: The Physical Theater

The abiotic environment is not merely the "stage" on which organisms perform—it actively determines what species can survive and which ecological strategies are advantageous.

### Climate Variables

**Temperature:**
Temperature affects enzyme activity (following a roughly exponential relationship until denaturation occurs), metabolic rates, and the distribution of organisms. The **"metabolic level boundaries hypothesis"** suggests that temperature constraints fundamentally limit which organisms can colonize different environments. Cold-adapted ectotherms can achieve lower metabolic rates through antifreeze proteins and behavioral adaptations, while warm-adapted organisms rely on high enzyme activity rates.

**Precipitation and Water Availability:**
Water availability creates a **precipitation gradient** that produces distinct biomes:
- >2000 mm/year: Tropical rainforests
- 1000-2000 mm/year: Deciduous and mixed forests
- 500-1000 mm/year: Grasslands and shrublands
- 250-500 mm/year: Deserts and semi-arid regions
- <250 mm/year: Extreme deserts

Critically, **seasonality** matters as much as total precipitation. A region receiving 1000 mm concentrated in three months (monsoon climate) has different ecology than one with even distribution throughout the year.

**Light Intensity:**
Solar radiation availability determines:
- **Compensation point:** The light intensity at which photosynthetic O₂ production equals respiration
- **Saturation point:** The light intensity beyond which photosynthesis cannot increase
- **Shade adaptation:** Species evolving in shade have lower light compensation points (enabling survival under low light but unable to exploit high light efficiently)

In aquatic ecosystems, light penetration creates the **photic zone** (euphotic zone >1% light; dysphotic zone <1% light; aphotic zone with zero light), limiting photosynthetic productivity to surface layers.

### Soil: The Foundation of Terrestrial Ecosystems

Soil is not simply "dirt"—it is a complex, living system that determines terrestrial ecosystem productivity more than any other factor.

**Soil Composition:**
- **Mineral matter** (40-50%): Sand, silt, clay
- **Organic matter** (5-10%): Living organisms, partially decomposed material
- **Water** (20-30%): Critical for nutrient transport
- **Air** (20-30%): Oxygen for aerobic respiration

**Soil Horizons (Profile):**
- **O horizon:** Organic matter accumulation (litter layer)
- **A horizon:** Topsoil with mixed mineral and organic matter, typically dark due to humus content
- **E horizon:** Eluvial layer; material leached downward
- **B horizon:** Illuvial layer; accumulation of clay and ions
- **C horizon:** Weathered parent material
- **R horizon:** Unweathered bedrock

**Soil Properties Affecting Productivity:**
- **pH:** Most nutrients are available at pH 6-8; acidic soils limit nutrient availability
- **Cation exchange capacity (CEC):** Soil's ability to hold positively charged ions; high CEC (clay soils) retains nutrients better than low CEC (sandy soils)
- **Aggregation:** Soil structure (how particles bind together) affects water-holding capacity and aeration
- **Microbial community:** Soil microbes (1 g soil contains ~1 billion bacteria) facilitate nutrient transformations

The relationship between soil and vegetation is reciprocal: vegetation type creates soil characteristics (acidic leaves create acidic soil; legumes enrich nitrogen), while soil determines what plants can grow.

## 1.4 Energy Flow: The Unidirectional Pathway

### Fundamental Thermodynamic Principles

Energy flow through ecosystems is governed by the laws of thermodynamics, making it fundamentally different from nutrient cycling:

**First Law (Conservation of Energy):**
Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed. The ~1.3 kW/m² of solar radiation reaching Earth's surface can be:
- Reflected back to space (~30% by atmospheric albedo)
- Absorbed by physical systems (warming atmosphere, soil, water)
- Fixed in chemical bonds through photosynthesis (~1% becomes chemical energy)

**Second Law (Entropy and Inefficiency):**
Every energy transformation increases entropy (disorder). As energy flows through organisms, much dissipates as heat through:
- Metabolic respiration
- Movement and maintenance
- Growth and reproduction
- Decomposition

This is why ecosystems require continuous energy input (from the sun) and cannot operate on recycled energy alone. Unlike nutrients (which cycle), energy flows one-way: captured, transformed, dissipated.

### Gross vs. Net Primary Production

**Gross Primary Production (GPP):**
GPP is the total photosynthetic carbon fixed by producers per unit time per unit area (measured in energy units: kJ/m²/year or carbon units: g C/m²/year).

GPP varies enormously across ecosystems:
- Tropical rainforests: 20-25 kg C/m²/year (highest terrestrial)
- Temperate forests: 10-15 kg C/m²/year
- Grasslands: 5-10 kg C/m²/year
- Deserts: 0.1-1 kg C/m²/year
- Open ocean: 1-3 kg C/m²/year (despite covering 70% of Earth)

**Net Primary Production (NPP):**
NPP = GPP - Respiration by Producers

Typically, producers respire 40-70% of fixed energy, leaving NPP as 30-60% of GPP. This NPP is the energy actually available to heterotrophs. A forest fixing 25 kg C/m²/year through photosynthesis might respire 15 kg C/m²/year (growing roots, leaves, stems), leaving 10 kg C/m²/year as NPP available for herbivores, decomposers, and storage.

**Net Ecosystem Production (NEP):**
NEP = NPP - Respiration by Consumers and Decomposers

NEP represents the energy remaining after all respiration. Positive NEP indicates the ecosystem is accumulating biomass (carbon sequestration); negative NEP indicates biomass decline.

### The 10% Rule and Energy Pyramids

When a herbivore consumes plant material, it captures energy but loses ~90%:
- ~10% is stored in herbivore biomass (growth)
- ~60-70% is lost as heat through metabolic respiration
- ~20-30% passes as feces and urine (not actually absorbed)

This creates **energy pyramids**:

```
Tertiary Consumer (Carnivore):      1 kcal/m²/year
    ↑ (from ~10 kcal primary consumer)
Secondary Consumer (Carnivore):    10 kcal/m²/year
    ↑ (from ~100 kcal herbivore)
Primary Consumer (Herbivore):     100 kcal/m²/year
    ↑ (from ~1,000 kcal producers)
Producer (Plants):             1,000 kcal/m²/year
    ↑
Solar Energy: 100,000+ kcal/m²/year
```


![Energy Flow Ecosystem](./cache/images/energy_flow_ecosystem.png)
*Energy Flow Pyramid*


**Critical Implications:**

1. **Limited trophic levels:** Rarely do more than 4-5 trophic levels exist (energy becomes too diluted). Most ecosystems have 3-4 functional levels.

2. **Herbivory efficiency:** 100 kg of plant material supports only 10 kg of herbivores, which supports only 1 kg of carnivores.

3. **Biomass distribution:** Pyramid of biomass (total living material) typically shows producers at the base being 10-100× heavier than primary consumers.

4. **Exception - Pyramid of numbers:** Can be inverted! A large tree (one organism) supports millions of insects (many organisms). But energy pyramids are never inverted.

5. **Dietary implications:** A human eating 1 kg of beef (secondary consumer energy) requires ~10 kg of grain (primary consumer energy), which requires ~100 kg of plant production. Vegetarian diets are 5-10× more efficient at feeding human populations.

### Food Chains vs. Food Webs

**Food Chains:**
Linear feeding relationships (Grass → Grasshopper → Sparrow → Hawk) are abstractions. They're useful for teaching but oversimplify reality:
- Organisms eat multiple prey species
- Prey species are consumed by multiple predators
- Decomposers operate at every level

**Food Webs:**
Complex networks showing realistic feeding relationships. In a grassland food web:
- Grass is consumed by grasshoppers, deer, and birds
- Grasshoppers are consumed by birds, spiders, and mice
- Spiders are consumed by birds
- All organisms eventually feed decomposers

Food webs reveal several patterns:

1. **Connectivity:** Most ecosystems have 2-5 feeding links between organisms (dietary generalists) and low connectivity (typically 1-3 connections per species).

2. **Weak links:** Most feeding relationships transfer energy inefficiently; a few "strong links" transfer most energy. Removing weak links has little ecosystem effect; removing strong links destabilizes the system.

3. **Omnivory prevalence:** Most organisms exploit multiple trophic levels, increasing energy transfer efficiency compared to perfectly linear chains.

4. **Detrital pathways:** Often equal or exceed grazing pathways in energy transfer. Dead organic matter fed to decomposers may equal or exceed energy consumed by herbivores.

### Trophic Cascades and Top-Down Control

The **trophic cascade** concept, validated by numerous studies, shows that removing or reintroducing apex predators triggers ecosystem-wide changes:

**Example: Kelp Forest Collapse (Pacific Northwest)**
- Sea otters were hunted to extinction for fur
- Without otters, sea urchin populations exploded (urchin predators were already depleted)
- Urchins consumed entire kelp forests, creating barren areas
- Reintroduction of sea otters reduced urchin populations
- Kelp forests returned, along with dependent species (fish, seals, eagles)

This demonstrates that **even small changes in top predator abundance create disproportionate ecosystem effects**. Terrestrial examples include wolves in Yellowstone, sharks in coral reefs, and jaguars in Central American forests—each shows that predator density fundamentally structures ecosystem organization.

## 1.5 Productivity Patterns and Ecosystem Gradients

### Latitudinal Productivity Gradient

Productivity generally decreases from equator to poles:
- **Equatorial regions:** High year-round sunlight, warm temperatures, high rainfall → Maximum photosynthesis → Highest productivity
- **Temperate regions:** Seasonal light variation, moderate temperatures, variable rainfall → Intermediate productivity
- **Polar regions:** Low year-round sunlight, cold temperatures, precipitation variable → Minimal productivity

**BUT:** Desert ecosystems near equator show low productivity despite high temperatures (limited by water), while some temperate ecosystems show high productivity (seasonal but intensive growth). Productivity is shaped by multiple factors, not latitude alone.

### Primary vs. Secondary Productivity

**Primary productivity** (autotroph production) is not uniformly distributed:
- Tropical rainforests, coral reefs, seagrass beds: 500-2000 g dry mass/m²/year
- Temperate forests, temperate grasslands: 200-500 g dry mass/m²/year
- Tundra, deserts: 10-100 g dry mass/m²/year
- Oligotrophic ocean (most ocean): <50 g dry mass/m²/year

**Secondary productivity** (heterotroph production) is typically 5-20% of primary productivity (accounting for trophic transfers):
- Productive grasslands supporting herbivores: 5-50 g/m²/year of herbivore biomass
- Forest ecosystems: 0.5-5 g/m²/year of carnivore biomass

This explains why herbivore biomass (and therefore predator biomass) can be predicted from primary productivity estimates.

# UNIT II: BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES - DETAILED MECHANISMS

## 2.1 Carbon Cycle: The Foundation of Life

### Overview and Significance

Carbon (atomic number 6) is the fourth most abundant element in the universe but the second most abundant in living organisms (after oxygen by mass). Carbon's chemistry (ability to form 4 covalent bonds, creating long chains and complex molecules) makes it foundational to all organic molecules.

The carbon cycle moves carbon between:
- **Atmosphere:** Primarily as CO₂ (425.7 ppm as of 2025)[web:67][web:70]
- **Biota:** Organic molecules in living and dead organisms
- **Lithosphere:** Rocks, minerals, fossil fuels
- **Hydrosphere:** Dissolved CO₂, bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻), carbonate (CO₃²⁻)


![Carbon Cycle](./cache/images/carbon_cycle.png)
*Carbon Cycle*

---

### Fast Carbon Cycle (Atmospheric)

**Photosynthesis:**
The entry point: CO₂ → organic molecules.

```
6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂
```

Annual plant photosynthesis fixes ~120 billion metric tons of carbon globally. This is split:
- ~60 billion tons returned to atmosphere through respiration the same year
- ~60 billion tons incorporated into plant biomass (leaves, stems, roots)

**Respiration (Aerobic):**
All organisms use oxygen to oxidize carbon compounds:

```
C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + energy
```

Respiration rates vary:
- **Basal respiration:** ~0.5-2% of body mass daily (maintaining basic functions)
- **Activity respiration:** Multiples higher during movement
- **Temperature-dependent:** Roughly doubles for every 10°C increase (Q₁₀ ≈ 2-3)

In tropical ecosystems, respiration consumes ~50% of GPP continuously; in temperate ecosystems with seasons, respiration varies seasonally.

**Decomposition:**
Dead organic matter is mineralized by decomposer communities. Carbon pathway:
Dead plant material → Glucose → Various intermediate metabolites → CO₂

**Temporal dynamics:** The living respiration component creates detectable annual atmospheric CO₂ oscillations:
- Northern Hemisphere winter (less photosynthesis): CO₂ increases
- Northern Hemisphere spring/summer (active photosynthesis): CO₂ decreases
- Amplitude: ~3-4 ppm annually

This creates "breathing" atmosphere—NASA satellites can track photosynthesis intensity by measuring CO₂ concentrations.

### Slow Carbon Cycle (Geological)

**Fossilization:**
In anaerobic conditions (swamps, ocean sediments), organic matter doesn't fully decompose:

```
[Organic matter] → [Peat (50% carbon)] → [Coal (80% carbon)] → [Oil/Gas]
```

This requires:
- Rapid burial (before decomposers consume it)
- Anaerobic conditions (no oxygen)
- Low temperatures (slowing metabolic rates)
- Stable conditions over millions of years

**Weathering and Rock Cycling:**
Silicate rocks weather through:

```
CaSiO₃ + CO₂ + H₂O → Ca²⁺ + HCO₃⁻ + SiO₂
```

This removes CO₂ from atmosphere over geological timescales. Calcium eventually precipitates:

```
Ca²⁺ + HCO₃⁻ → CaCO₃ + H⁺
```

Forming limestone, which can be:
- Buried (long-term carbon storage)
- Subducted (melted, returning CO₂ to atmosphere through volcanoes)

### Anthropogenic Perturbations

**Fossil Fuel Combustion:**
Annual emissions: 2025 record of 38.1 Gt CO₂ (10.4 Gt carbon)[web:67][web:70]

Carbon sources:
- Coal (~40%): Slowest carbon cycle; coal formed hundreds of millions years ago
- Oil (~35%): Liquid petroleum, similar age
- Natural gas (~20%): Cleaner but still fossil
- Cement/other (~5%): Including limestone thermal decomposition

**Deforestation:**
Removes carbon sinks (photosynthesizing trees) and releases stored carbon:
- Direct emissions: Burning or decomposing felled trees
- Opportunity cost: Lost future photosynthesis
- Soil carbon loss: Disturbed soil releases carbon through accelerated decomposition

**Land Use Change:**
Agriculture, urbanization replace high-productivity natural ecosystems with lower-productivity human systems:
- Forest to pasture: Net carbon loss
- Grassland to agriculture: Mixed effects (crops remove carbon annually, but plow disturbs soil carbon)

### Climate Feedback Loops

**Positive Feedback (Amplification):**
- Warming → More decomposition → More CO₂ → More warming
- Sea ice loss → Reduced albedo → More solar absorption → More warming

**Negative Feedback (Dampening):**
- Higher CO₂ → More photosynthesis → More carbon uptake → Reduced CO₂
- But this feedback is weak (plants saturate at ~1000 ppm CO₂)

Current data shows positive feedbacks dominating, explaining accelerating climate change despite only 50% increase in emissions (not exponential, suggesting added feedbacks).

## 2.2 Nitrogen Cycle: Complex Bacterial Transformations

### Overview and Biological Importance

Nitrogen (N) is:
- 78% of atmosphere as N₂ (triple-bonded, extremely stable)
- Essential in proteins (enzymes, structural), nucleic acids (DNA/RNA)
- Often limiting nutrient in natural ecosystems

Paradoxically, N₂ gas is **biologically unavailable** to most organisms despite being abundant in air. Plants cannot directly fix N₂; only nitrogen-fixing bacteria possess the nitrogenase enzyme.

### Nitrogen Fixation

**Biological Nitrogen Fixation:**

```
N₂ + 8e⁻ + 16 ATP + 16H₂O → 2NH₃ + H₂ + 16ADP + 16Pi
```


![Nitrogen Cycle](./cache/images/nitrogen_cycle.png)
*N-Cycle (Bacteria)*


This is energetically expensive (costs ~16 ATP per N₂ fixed). Only specific bacteria and archaea perform this:

1. **Free-living bacteria:**
   - Azotobacter (aerobic, soil)
   - Cyanobacteria (photosynthetic, aquatic and terrestrial)

2. **Symbiotic bacteria:**
   - *Rhizobium* in legume root nodules (most significant)
   - Actinobacteria in non-legume shrubs and trees

3. **Archaeal nitrifiers:** Recently discovered archaea fix nitrogen in extreme environments

**Legume-Rhizobium Symbiosis:**
- Plant exudes flavonoid signals → Rhizobium chemotaxis
- Bacterial lipopolysaccharides trigger plant nodule formation
- Bacteria fix N₂ inside specialized root cells
- Plant provides carbohydrates (photosynthate) → Bacteria provide fixed N

Nitrogen transferred: 50-300 kg/ha/year depending on legume species and conditions.

**Industrial Nitrogen Fixation:**
The Haber-Bosch process (creating ammonia from N₂ and H₂ under high temperature/pressure) now fixes more nitrogen annually (~120 million tons) than biological fixation globally (~100-200 million tons). This is why synthetic fertilizers dominate agriculture.

### Ammonification (Mineralization)

**Definition:** Conversion of organic N to inorganic ammonia (NH₃).

```
Amino acids/Proteins/Nucleic acids → (bacterial decomposition) → NH₃/NH₄⁺
```

Process:
- Proteases break proteins into amino acids
- Amino acid oxidative deamination removes NH₃
- Remaining carbon skeleton enters respiration

**Key organisms:**
- Heterotrophic bacteria
- Fungi
- Actinobacteria

**Conditions favorable:**
- Warm temperatures (accelerates enzyme kinetics)
- High moisture (enables microbial activity)
- Neutral to slightly alkaline pH (ammonia is volatile at pH >8)

Ammonification rate can be predicted from:
- C:N ratio of material (material with C:N >20 immobilizes nitrogen as microbes retain it; material with C:N <20 releases nitrogen)
- Litter quality (nitrogen-rich grass decomposes faster than carbon-rich wood)

### Nitrification: Oxidation to Nitrite and Nitrate

**Two-step process (energy-yielding for bacteria):**

**Step 1: Ammonia → Nitrite**
```
2NH₄⁺ + 3O₂ → 2NO₂⁻ + 4H⁺ + 2H₂O
```
Catalyzed by *Nitrosomonas* and *Nitrosococcus* (ammonia-oxidizing bacteria)

**Step 2: Nitrite → Nitrate**
```
2NO₂⁻ + O₂ → 2NO₃⁻
```
Catalyzed by *Nitrobacter* and *Nitrosolobus* (nitrite-oxidizing bacteria)

**Energy source:** These bacteria are chemolithotrophs, oxidizing N compounds and using the energy to fix CO₂.

**Conditions required:**
- Aerobic (oxygen as electron acceptor)
- Neutral to slightly alkaline pH
- Moderate ammonia concentrations
- Temperature between 5-45°C (optimum ~30°C)

**Ecological significance:**
- Creates plant-available nitrate
- Is oxidative (removes electrons), contributing to soil acidification
- Can be rapid in warm, well-aerated soils

In waterlogged soils, nitrification is blocked (anaerobic), and ammonia accumulates. Then when soils drain, rapid nitrification occurs, potentially leaching nitrate into groundwater.

### Denitrification: Return to Atmosphere

**Definition:** Anaerobic reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas (N₂).

```
NO₃⁻ → NO₂⁻ → NO → N₂O → N₂
```

**Key organisms:**
- *Pseudomonas* species
- *Bacillus* species
- Many other facultative anaerobes

**Process:**
These bacteria use nitrate as terminal electron acceptor in anaerobic respiration:
```
5 Acetate + 4 NO₃⁻ → 4 N₂ + 2 CO₂ + 4 H₂O + (remaining organic products)
```

**Conditions required:**
- Anaerobic environment (flooded soils, bottom sediments, biofilms)
- Carbon source (organic matter)
- Nitrate source

**Ecological significance:**
- Completes nitrogen cycle by returning N₂ to atmosphere
- Major loss pathway for bioavailable nitrogen from ecosystems
- Can be >50% of N cycling in wetlands

**Human impact:**
- Agricultural nitrogen loss (estimated 20-40% of applied fertilizer denitrified)
- *N₂O is potent greenhouse gas* (298× CO₂ warming potential over 100 years)
- Anthropogenic N₂O production from agriculture now rivals natural sources

### Alternative Pathway: Dissimilatory Nitrate Reduction to Ammonium (DNRA)

**Definition:** Anaerobic reduction of nitrate to ammonia (retains nitrogen in ecosystem).

```
NO₃⁻ + 8e⁻ + 10H⁺ → NH₄⁺ + 3H₂O
```

**Ecological significance:**
- Conserves nitrogen in ecosystem (vs. denitrification loss)
- Competes with denitrifying bacteria for nitrate
- Dominates in high C:N ratio systems where carbon is abundant relative to nitrogen

**Competition outcome:** When C:N ratio is high, DNRA dominates (bacteriamaintain nitrogen); when C:N is low, denitrification dominates (bacteria release nitrogen).

### Complete Nitrogen Cycle Integration

```

**Timescale:** Complete cycle can occur in days (rapid cycling in cultivated soils) to years (slow cycling in natural ecosystems).

## 2.3 Phosphorus Cycle: Geological Constraints

### Overview and Criticality

Phosphorus (P) is:
- Essential in ATP (energy molecule), phospholipids (membranes), nucleic acids
- Unlike N and C, has NO atmospheric reservoir (P never exists as gas)
- Most limiting nutrient in many ecosystems
- Finite resource; easily depleted

### Key Difference: Geological Dependence

Unlike C and N cycles which have atmospheric components:
```
Phosphorus: Rock weathering → Soil → Uptake by organisms → Return to soil/water
```

Atmospheric loss is minimal (some phosphorus aerosol particles, but negligible).

### Weathering: The Source

**Physical weathering:**
Mechanical breakdown of rock (frost-thaw cycles, root penetration, glaciation) increases surface area, facilitating chemical weathering.

**Chemical weathering:**
```
Apatite [Ca₅(PO₄)₃OH] + H₂O + acids → Soluble phosphate + Ca²⁺ + other products
```

Acids involved:
- Carbonic acid (H₂CO₃) from CO₂ + water
- Organic acids from plant root exudates
- Microbial organic acids

**Rate factors:**
- Precipitation (increases weathering rate; dissolved CO₂ increases acidity)
- Temperature (higher T accelerates reactions)
- Rock type (apatite weathers faster than granite)
- Vegetation (plants accelerate weathering via root acids)

Weathering rate: ~30-100 kg P/ha/year in temperate soils (varies 10-fold by conditions).

### Bioavailability Problem

Critical challenge: Dissolved phosphate readily precipitates:

**In acidic soils:**
```
H₂PO₄⁻ + Al³⁺/Fe³⁺ → Insoluble aluminum/iron phosphates
```
Plants cannot access precipitated phosphate.

**In alkaline soils:**
```
H₂PO₄⁻ + Ca²⁺ → Insoluble calcium phosphates (apatite-like)
```

**Result:** Often <1% of total soil phosphorus is in bioavailable form (dissolved phosphate). Plants and microorganisms evolved strategies to access insoluble phosphorus:
- Root exudation of phosphatases (enzymes breaking organic P)
- Mycorrhizal associations (fungal hyphae mobilize P)
- Production of organic acids (solubilizing precipitated P)

### Biological Cycling

**Assimilation:**
Plants absorb orthophosphate (PO₄³⁻):
- Incorporated into ATP, phospholipids, nucleic acids
- Rapid uptake (can extract bioavailable P in months)

**Transfer through food web:**
- Herbivores assimilate ~50-70% of plant phosphorus
- Carnivores assimilate ~50-70% of prey phosphorus
- Decomposers remineralize phosphorus from dead organic matter

**Excretion and Return:**
Animal feces are major phosphorus return pathway (~40-80% of phosphorus consumed in feces, not urine). This is why phosphorus cycles largely through the solid phase (vs. nitrogen cycling through solution in many steps).

### Loss Pathways (Eutrophication Trigger)

**Leaching into groundwater:**
In highly weathered, acidic soils, some phosphate dissolves and percolates below root zone (especially under high rainfall).

**Runoff and erosion:**
Sediment bound phosphorus leaves terrestrial ecosystems:
- From eroded soil particles
- From agricultural fields (topsoil loss at ~30 tons/ha/year in intensive agriculture)
- From urban stormwater runoff

**Aquatic eutrophication:**
When P-rich runoff enters lakes/streams:
```
Soluble phosphate + sunlight + nitrate → Algal bloom
```

Explosive algal growth → Death and decomposition → Anaerobic conditions → Fish kills

Eutrophication irreversibly degrades aquatic ecosystems, creating "dead zones" (e.g., Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone covers ~20,000 km²).

### Phosphorus and Human Activity

**Agricultural amendment:**
- Global P mining: ~200 million tons/year
- Applied to fields: ~15-20 million tons/year of phosphate fertilizer
- Efficiency: Only ~10-15% used by crops; rest leaches, runs off, or immobilizes in soil
- Mineral reserves: At current extraction rates, rock phosphate reserves last ~100-300 years (depending on assumptions about future extraction rates)

**Recycling potential:**
Humans could recover phosphorus from:
- Agricultural runoff
- Sewage treatment plants
- Animal manure (currently often wasted)
- Food waste

Currently <5% of global P is recycled; shifting to circular economy is critical for long-term sustainability.

### Sulfur Cycle (Brief)

**Overview:**
Sulfur (S) cycles through atmosphere (SO₂ gas), soil (sulfate), and biota (sulfur amino acids). Similar to phosphorus in terrestrial phase, but unlike P, has atmospheric component.

**Key processes:**
- **Oxidation:** Anaerobic bacteria oxidize H₂S → sulfate (in hydrothermal vents, sulfide-rich sediments)
- **Reduction:** Sulfate-reducing bacteria reduce SO₄²⁻ → H₂S (in anaerobic soils, water bodies)
- **Atmospheric:** Volcanic SO₂ emissions, industrial combustion emissions

**Human impact:**
- Sulfur dioxide from coal burning → Acid rain (SO₂ + H₂O → H₂SO₄)
- Historical problem; now reduced in developed nations but severe in Asia

# UNIT III: ECOLOGICAL SUCCESSION AND COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY

## 3.1 Ecological Succession: Definition and Conceptual Framework

**Definition:** Ecological succession is the directional, **predictable sequence of community changes** following disturbance or colonization of new habitat.

**Historical context:**
- Concept developed by Frederic Clements (1916): Climax community theory
- Subsequent ecologists (Connell, Sousa, Pickett) refined understanding
- Modern view: Dynamic, non-equilibrium systems with multiple stable states

### Drivers of Succession

**Mechanism 1: Facilitation**
Early colonizers modify environment, enabling later arrivals:
- Pioneer lichens break down rock → Soil formation → Moss colonization → Higher plants
- Nitrogen-fixing legumes increase soil N → Support demanding species

**Mechanism 2: Tolerance**
Later species can tolerate competitive exclusion by early arrivals:
- Shade-tolerant tree seedlings establish under pioneer shade
- Wait-and-release strategy (germinate only when resource available)

**Mechanism 3: Inhibition**
Early colonizers actively prevent later arrivals:
- Allelopathic plants produce toxins inhibiting competitors
- Dense coverage shades competitors
- Accumulation of litter can inhibit seed germination

Different mechanisms dominate at different successional stages, creating complex community assembly patterns.

![Ecological Succession](./cache/images/succession_diagram.png)
*Succession Comparison*

## 3.2 Primary Succession: Starting from Bare Rock

**Definition:** Colonization of newly exposed or formed land with no soil and no plant legacy.

### Classical Example: Glacier Recession

When glaciers retreat, they expose barren rock and sediment:

**Stages:**

1. **Pioneer Stage (0-10 years):**
   - Lichens and mosses dominate
   - Algae within lichen fix nitrogen
   - Root acids slowly weather rock
   - No soil yet (biochemical weathering just beginning)
   - Biomass: <1 g/m²

2. **Early Herbaceous Stage (10-50 years):**
   - Soil formation accelerates (accumulating lichen, moss fragments; weathered rock)
   - Herbaceous plants establish (grasses, forbs)
   - Some woody species pioneer shrubs
   - Nitrogen accumulation from lichen/nitrogen-fixing plants
   - Soil now ~2-5 cm deep
   - Biomass: 10-50 g/m²

3. **Shrub Stage (50-150 years):**
   - Woody shrubs dominate
   - Soil depth now 10-20 cm
   - Soil organic matter accumulation
   - Shade-tolerant tree seedlings colonizing understory
   - Biomass: 500-2000 g/m²

4. **Pioneer Forest Stage (150-400 years):**
   - Shade-intolerant trees (birch, alder, Douglas-fir) dominate
   - Soil now 20-40 cm deep
   - Substantial organic matter
   - Shade-tolerant tree seedlings (hemlock, spruce) established
   - Biomass: 3000-8000 g/m²

5. **Climax Forest Stage (>400 years):**
   - Shade-tolerant species dominate
   - Soil well-developed (40+ cm, stable)
   - Stable species composition (assuming no disturbance)
   - Biomass: 10,000-15,000 g/m² (varies by climate)

**Timeline:** Primary succession is slow; complete development takes **centuries to millennia** depending on climate.

**Limiting factors:**
- Soil formation rate (~1-5 cm per century in temperate regions; faster in tropical regions; slower in high mountains/tundra)
- Propagule availability (proximity of seed sources)
- Climate suitability

## 3.3 Secondary Succession: Regrowth After Disturbance

**Definition:** Recolonization following partial ecosystem disturbance when soil and buried seeds/roots remain.

### Common Disturbances

- Fire
- Windstorm
- Flooding
- Deforestation
- Agricultural abandonment
- Grazing

### Classical Example: Post-Fire Forest Succession

**Immediately after fire (0-1 year):**
- Charred vegetation, exposed soil
- Rapid nutrient release (ash provides P, K, minerals)
- Some soil carbon loss
- Hydrophobic soil layer (water-repellent, slowing rainfall infiltration)

**Pioneer Stage (1-5 years):**
- Pioneer herbs and grasses colonize
- Nitrogen-fixing plants (lupine, fireweed) establish
- Growth is rapid (nutrients available, low competition)
- Some early-succession trees establish (aspen, pine)
- Biomass accumulation: 50-200 g/m²/year

**Early Forest Stage (5-50 years):**
- Shade-intolerant trees (pine, Douglas-fir) dominate
- Understory filling in
- Soil recovering (organic matter rebuilding)
- Some shade-tolerant seedlings colonizing
- Biomass accumulation: 200-500 g/m²/year

**Late Forest Stage (50-200 years):**
- Transition to shade-tolerant species
- Lower-layer shade-intolerant trees dying (self-thinning)
- Soil properties approaching pre-fire conditions
- Forest structure becoming stratified
- Biomass accumulation: 100-300 g/m²/year (slowing)

**Mature Forest Stage (200+ years):**
- Shade-tolerant species dominate
- Multi-aged population structure
- Soil mature
- Biomass accumulation minimal; cycling dominates
- Forest stable until next disturbance

**Key differences from primary succession:**
- **Speed:** 5-20× faster than primary succession (soil already present)
- **Composition:** Often dominated by different species than climax forest (pioneer species adapted to disturbed conditions not present in mature forest)
- **Heterogeneity:** Multiple seral stages can coexist at landscape level (mosaic of different-aged patches)

## 3.4 The Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH)

### Concept

Species diversity is **maximized at intermediate disturbance frequencies**—not too rare, not too frequent.

### Mechanism

**At low disturbance frequencies:**
- Competitive exclusion occurs
- Few dominant species monopolize resources
- Rare species outcompeted
- Low diversity

**Example:** Undisturbed forest dominated by 3-5 tall tree species; understory suppressed

**At intermediate disturbance frequencies:**
- Before dominants exclude competitors, disturbance resets competition
- Patches at different successional stages coexist
- Competitive dominants controlled; subordinates persist
- **Maximum diversity**

**Example:** Forest with frequent small fires maintains diverse age/species structure; pioneer and late-successional species coexist

**At high disturbance frequencies:**
- Only disturbance-tolerant colonizers survive
- Late-successional species eliminated
- Low diversity (only early-successional species)

**Example:** Heavily grazed grassland dominated by 1-2 grazing-tolerant species; sensitive species eliminated

### Mathematical Framework

IDH predicts a hump-shaped relationship between disturbance frequency/intensity and biodiversity. This relationship varies:
- **Space-dependent:** Patch size affects diversity response
- **Disturbance type-dependent:** Different disturbances affect different taxa differently
- **Community-dependent:** Disturbance effects vary among communities

### Empirical Evidence and Criticisms

**Supporting evidence:**
- Intermediate-burn frequency forests show higher tree diversity
- Intermediate-grazing intensity grasslands maximize herbaceous diversity
- Intermediate-wave-disturbance rocky shores maximize algal/invertebrate diversity

**Criticisms:**
- Hypothesis not universally supported; exceptions exist
- Diversity curves sometimes differ from predicted hump shape
- Context-dependency makes predictions difficult
- Alternative mechanisms sometimes explain diversity patterns better

**Current understanding:** IDH explains biodiversity patterns in many systems but is not universal. Other factors (habitat heterogeneity, colonization-competition trade-offs, spatial structure) also fundamentally determine diversity.

## 3.5 Climax Communities: Concept Evolution

### Original Concept (Clements, 1916)

- Succession proceeds to stable **climax** state
- Climax determined by climate (monoclimax theory)
- Endpoint is deterministic; all similar climates → similar climax communities
- Self-perpetuating (no further change without disturbance)

### Modern Understanding (Pickettc, Whittaker, Connell, et al.)

- Multiple stable states possible (not single climax)
- Non-equilibrium dynamics; disturbance integral to system
- Landscape heterogeneity creates mosaic of communities
- "Climax" concept largely abandoned in scientific community

Modern view:
```
Disturbance → Succession → Disturbance (cycle repeats)
            ↓ (if sufficient time)
         Dynamic Equilibrium (not true climax)
```

### Why Climax Concept Persists

1. **Conceptually useful:** Represents mature forest/grassland state recognizable to ecologists
2. **Management implications:** Suggests target state for conservation ("recover original climax")
3. **Pedagogical simplicity:** Easier to teach than non-equilibrium dynamics

### Practical Implications of Non-Equilibrium Understanding

1. **Conservation:** Can't simply "recover" disturbed ecosystems to pre-disturbance state; must allow successional processes
2. **Land management:** Different disturbance regimes create different communities; need active management if specific community desired
3. **Climate change:** As climate shifts, "climax" target communities become mismatched to current climate; must accept ecosystem reorganization

# UNIT IV: SPECIES INTERACTIONS AND COMMUNITY STRUCTURE

![Ecological Succession](./cache/images/succession_diagram.png)
*Succession Comparison*


## 4.1 Competition: The Struggle for Shared Resources

### Types of Competition

**Intraspecific competition:** Within-species competition (individuals of same species compete for resources)
- Density-dependent (competition intensity increases with population density)
- Results in regulation of population growth

**Interspecific competition:** Between-species competition (different species compete for same resources)
- Can exclude species from habitat
- Drives niche differentiation
- Shapes community structure

### Competition Mechanisms

**Exploitative (Scramble) Competition:**
Competitors reduce resource availability for others by consuming resources.
- First arrivals consume resources; latecomers get less
- Everyone shares equally regardless of ability to exploit
- Common in plants (root competition for water/nutrients)

**Interference (Contest) Competition:**
Competitors actively prevent others from accessing resources.
- Territorial behavior; direct aggression
- Dominants secure resources; subordinates excluded
- Common in animals (territorial birds, aggressive fish)

### Lotka-Volterra Competition Model

Mathematical framework for interspecific competition:

**Two-species model:**

```
dN₁/dt = r₁N₁[(K₁ - N₁ - αN₂)/K₁]
dN₂/dt = r₂N₂[(K₂ - N₂ - βN₁)/K₂]
```

Where:
- N₁, N₂ = population sizes
- r₁, r₂ = intrinsic rates of increase
- K₁, K₂ = carrying capacities
- α, β = competition coefficients (effect of species 2 on species 1's growth, and vice versa)

**Key parameter:** Competition coefficient (α)
- If α = 0.5: One individual of species 2 suppresses species 1's growth as much as 0.5 individuals of species 1
- If α > 1: Species 2 is more effective competitor than species 1 individuals
- If α < 1: Species 2 is less effective competitor

**Predicted Outcomes:**

1. **Species 1 wins:** If species 1 sufficiently superior competitor (K₁ and intrinsic rate favor species 1)
2. **Species 2 wins:** If species 2 sufficiently superior competitor
3. **Coexistence:** If species limit each other more than self-limit (rarely stable)
4. **Unstable coexistence:** Temporary coexistence; actual outcome depends on initial conditions

**Critical insight:** Two species cannot stably coexist if they use identical resources. **Competitive Exclusion Principle (Gause's Law):** *"Complete competitors cannot coexist; one must be excluded."*

### Experimental Validation

**Gause (1934) experiments:**
- Cultured *Paramecium aurelia* and *Paramecium caudatum* separately (both thrived)
- Cultured together → *P. aurelia* competitively excluded *P. caudatum*
- Attributed to *P. aurelia* superior exploitation of available resources

**Park (1948) experiments on flour beetles:**
- Two *Tribolium* species competed in flour ("universe")
- Superior competitor depended on environmental conditions:
  - Humid conditions: *T. castaneum* won
  - Dry conditions: *T. confusum* won
  - Intermediate conditions: Variable (whichever species had larger initial population won)

**Key insight:** Competitive outcomes are context-dependent; environmental conditions favor different competitors.

### Niche Differentiation: Avoiding Competitive Exclusion

If coexisting species don't directly exclude each other, they must differ in resource use. **Niche differentiation** describes this divergence:

**Example 1: Warblers in North American forests**
Multiple warbler species coexist in same forest by foraging at different:
- Tree heights (canopy vs. understory)
- Microhabitats (branch tips, trunks, ground)
- Feeding techniques (gleaning vs. hawking)
- Seasonal timing (breed at different times)

**Example 2: Darwin's finches (Galápagos)**
Coexisting finch species differ in:
- Beak size and shape (determining seed size exploitation)
- Foraging substrate (ground vs. trees)
- Nesting habitat (cliffs vs. trees)

**Mechanisms enabling differentiation:**
1. **Resource subdivision:** Species partition available resources (different food types, microhabitats, feeding times)
2. **Fundamental vs. realized niche:** Fundamental niche (where species can survive without competition); realized niche (where species actually lives, compressed by competition)

**Competitive release:** When competitor removed, species expands into competitor's former resources.
- Example: When starfish *Pisaster* removed from rocky shore, mussels monopolized space; when starfish returned, diversity increased

### Competition and Community Organization

Strong competitors create **competitive hierarchies**:
- Superior competitors monopolize best resources
- Inferior competitors relegated to marginal habitats
- Diversity maintained by spatial heterogeneity (marginal habitats provide refuges for inferior competitors)

## 4.2 Predation and Herbivory: Population Control Through Consumption

### Predator-Prey Dynamics: Lotka-Volterra Model

Mathematical framework predicting population cycles:

```
dN/dt = bPN - mN    (Prey growth, reduced by predation)
dP/dt = acPN - dP   (Predator growth from prey consumed, minus mortality)
```

Where:
- N = prey population
- P = predator population  
- b = prey birth rate
- m = prey death rate (starvation)
- a = predator attack rate
- c = conversion efficiency (prey to predator biomass)
- d = predator death rate

**Predicted cycles:**

```
Time →
Prey population  [Peak] ──→ [Decline] ──→ [Low] ──→ [Recovery] ──→ [Peak]
                    ↓                ↓
Predator population    [Low] ──→ [Rising] ──→ [Peak] ──→ [Decline] ──→ [Low]
```

**Mechanism:**
1. **Prey abundant** (predator scarce) → Predators increase (food plentiful)
2. **Predators abundant** → Prey decline (heavy predation)
3. **Prey rare** → Predators starve (food scarce)
4. **Predators rare** → Prey recover (reduced predation)
5. **Cycle repeats**

**Time lag:** Predator dynamics lag behind prey by ~¼ cycle (predators slow to respond to prey changes).

### Empirical Examples

**Classic: Lynx-Hare Cycles (Canadian fur trade data)**
- Hare populations peak every 10 years
- Lynx populations peak 1-2 years after hare peaks
- Cycle driven by predator-prey dynamics AND resource limitation (hare food availability also oscillates)

**Flour beetles and parasitic wasp:**
- Beetle (host) and wasp (parasitoid) show cyclical dynamics in laboratory
- Initially: Beetles and wasps increase together
- Then: Beetle population crashes (parasitized eggs)
- Then: Wasp population crashes (no hosts)
- Cycle repeats

**Algae and zooplankton in lakes:**
- Spring: Algae bloom (nutrient-rich water, low zooplankton)
- Early summer: Zooplankton population crashes algae (heavy grazing)
- Mid-summer: Zooplankton starve (algae depleted); algae bloom again
- Seasonal cycles overlay multiyear cycles

### Limitations of Lotka-Volterra Model

1. **Assumes simple dynamics:** Real systems have complexity (multiple prey, multiple predators, spatial heterogeneity, environmental variability)

2. **Stable cycles unrealistic:** Model predicts neutral stability (cycles persist indefinitely); real populations either stabilize or crash

3. **Multiple equilibria ignored:** Both predator and prey can regulate at multiple densities

4. **Spatial structure ignored:** Localized extinctions/colonizations change dynamics

**Modern understanding:** Predator-prey dynamics are important but operate within context of:
- Resource availability (prey nutritional quality/quantity)
- Spatial structure (refugia for prey, dispersal pathways)
- Environmental stochasticity (weather, disease)
- Multiple trophic levels and prey species

### Predator Adaptations

Predators evolve mechanisms to:
- **Increase feeding success:** Camouflage, ambush tactics, pursuit speed, sensory acuity
- **Overcome prey defenses:** Specialized mouthparts, toxin resistance, cooperative hunting
- **Maximize energy intake:** Prey selection (specializing on profitable prey)

### Prey Defenses

Prey evolve countermeasures:
- **Morphological:** Shells, spines, body size
- **Chemical:** Toxins, alkaloids, secondary metabolites (famously, monarch butterfly toxin-sequestration)
- **Behavioral:** Vigilance, grouping, escape routes
- **Life history:** Early reproduction (producing offspring before eaten)
- **Camouflage and warning coloration:** Blending (camouflage) vs. advertising toxicity (warning colors)

### Arms Race Dynamics

Predators and prey engage in **coevolutionary arms races:**
- Predator evolves improved hunting → Prey evolves improved defense
- Prey defense improves → Predator counters → Etc.

Example: Snakes (*Thamnophis*) and toxic newts (*Triturus*):
- Toxic newt population in Oregon lake had tetrodotoxin (~1000× lethal human dose)
- Local snake population evolved resistance mutations (block sodium channels, preventing toxin entry)
- But resistance trades off against swimming speed
- Snakes from non-toxic populations couldn't survive toxic newts (lacking mutations)

---

## 4.3 Symbiotic Relationships: Mutualism, Commensalism, Parasitism

### Mutualism: +/+ Relationships

**Definition:** Both species benefit from association.

**Type 1: Obligate mutualism**
Partners cannot survive independently; relationship is genetically/physiologically integrated.

Example: Lichens
- Fungus (mycobiont) and alga/cyanobacterium (photobiont)
- Fungus: Obtains 50%+ of photosynthate from alga
- Alga: Protected from desiccation, given water and minerals
- Together: Survive harsh environments (rocks, artic, desert) impossible for either alone

Example: Flowering plants and pollinators
- Bee visits flower (seeking nectar): Transfers pollen accidentally
- Plant reproduction via pollen transfer (specific to pollinator's morphology)
- Bee gains nutrition; plant gains reproductive success
- Specificity: Some plants pollinated only by one bee species; losing bees means reproductive failure

Example: Legume-Rhizobium symbiosis
- Plant provides carbohydrates to bacteria
- Bacteria provide fixed nitrogen (10x cost of plant acquiring N from soil)

**Type 2: Facultative mutualism**
Partners benefit but can survive independently; association is opportunistic.

Example: Cleaning symbiosis (fish)
- Cleaner fish eat parasites/dead skin from larger fish
- Larger fish groomed (parasites removed); cleaner fed
- Either could survive without the other

Example: Ant-aphid mutualisms
- Ants "farm" aphids (protect from predators, farm honeydew)
- Aphids obtain protection; can reach higher densities with ant protection
- Ants gain carbohydrate-rich honeydew
- But both species also occur without mutualism

### Commensalism: +/0 Relationships

**Definition:** One species benefits; other is unaffected.

Example: Remoras and sharks
- Remora fish attach to shark, travel long distances, feed on scraps
- Shark unaffected (not parasitized; minimal drag)

Example: Orchids on rainforest trees
- Orchid perches on tree branch (no root damage)
- Tree unaffected (doesn't provide nutrients; orchid doesn't harm tree)

Example: Phoresy (transportation symbiosis)
- Mites attach to larger insects for transportation to new habitat
- Carrier unaffected (minimal cost)

**Common in nature:** Many apparent "neutral" relationships probably aren't—slight costs/benefits often exist with detailed examination.

### Parasitism: +/- Relationships

**Definition:** Parasite benefits; host is harmed.

**Type 1: Ectoparasites**
Live externally:
- Mosquitoes, ticks, lice, fleas
- Draw blood/lymph directly from host
- Typically don't kill host (dead host = dead parasite)

**Type 2: Endoparasites**
Live internally:
- Nematode worms, tapeworms, protozoans
- Consume host body tissues or blood
- Some extremely harmful (malaria parasite kills millions)

**Type 3: Parasitoids**
Lay eggs in/on host; larva develops by consuming host from inside; eventually kills host.
- Parasitoid wasps (*Ichneumonidae*, *Braconidae*) lay eggs in insects
- Wasp larva feeds on host, eventually kills it (host death required for parasitoid life cycle)
- Critical biological control agents

### Parasite-Host Population Dynamics

**Parasite effects on host populations:**
1. **Reduced survival:** Infected hosts die at higher rates
2. **Reduced reproduction:** Infections divert energy from reproduction
3. **Reduced competitive ability:** Weakened hosts lose to non-infected competitors

**Paradox:** If parasite kills host too quickly, parasite population crashes (loss of habitat). If parasite too benign, host population not regulated. **Optimal virulence:** Selection favors intermediate parasite virulence (kills host slowly enough to maintain host population).

**Density dependence:** At high host density, parasites can maintain host at depressed levels; at low host density, parasites starve.

### Evolutionary Consequences of Parasitism

Hosts evolve resistance:
- Immune system complexity
- Behavioral defenses (grooming, avoidance)
- Genetic variability (polymorphism; resistance to current parasite strain varies)

Parasites evolve virulence and transmission strategies:
- Mechanisms to overcome host immunity
- Transmission adaptations (increase transmission rate before killing host)
- Life cycle specializations

Result: Ongoing coevolutionary dynamic (parasite and host drive each other's evolution).

**Host-Pathogen Cycles:** If pathogen populations crash due to host resistance evolution, susceptible hosts recover → Pathogen can re-invade → Cycle repeats.

# UNIT V: BIODIVERSITY - MEASUREMENT, PATTERNS, AND CONSERVATION

## 5.1 Biodiversity Defined: Multiple Scales

**Biodiversity encompasses:**
- **Genetic diversity:** Genetic variation within species (populations, individuals)
- **Species diversity:** Number of species (species richness)
- **Ecosystem diversity:** Variety of ecosystem types

### Levels of Diversity

**Alpha (α) diversity:**
Diversity within a single site/habitat/community. Measured by:
- Species richness (S): Number of species
- Relative abundance: Proportions of each species

**Beta (β) diversity:**
Diversity between sites; species turnover from one location to another.
- High β-diversity: Different species at different sites
- Low β-diversity: Same species repeated across sites

**Gamma (γ) diversity:**
Diversity across entire region/landscape; integration of α and β.

```
γ-diversity = α-diversity + β-diversity (roughly)
```

High γ-diversity indicates many species overall; can result from:
- High α-diversity everywhere (similar sites, each species-rich)
- Low α-diversity everywhere but high β-diversity (different species at each site)

### Measuring Alpha Diversity

**Species Richness (S):**
Simply: Total number of species present.

Advantages: Easy, intuitive
Disadvantages: Biased toward easily observed species; incomplete sampling misses rare species

**Species Evenness (E):**
How equally abundant are species? Range 0-1:
- E = 1: All species equally abundant (perfect evenness)
- E → 0: Few dominant species, many rare species (low evenness)

**Shannon-Wiener Index (H'):**
Combines richness and evenness; measures information content:

```
H' = -Σ(pᵢ ln pᵢ)
```

Where pᵢ = proportion of individuals in species i.

- H' = 0: Single species only
- H' typically 1.5-3.5 for natural communities (higher values = greater diversity)
- Highly sensitive to common species; rare species contribute little

**Simpson Index (D or 1-D):**
Probability that two randomly selected individuals are different species:

```
D = 1 - Σ(pᵢ²)
```

- D = 0: Single species only
- D = 1: Infinite species (each individual unique)
- Typically 0.5-0.95 (higher = greater diversity)
- Emphasizes dominance; rare species contribute little

**Comparison:**
- Shannon emphasizes evenness (rare species contribute to index)
- Simpson emphasizes dominance (how likely to pick different species at random)

Both increase with species richness and evenness; selection depends on research question.

### Species-Area Relationship

**Pattern:** Larger areas contain more species.

```
S = cA^z
```

Where:
- S = species number
- A = area
- c, z = empirical parameters
- z typically 0.2-0.4 (species increase slower than area increases)

**Implications:**
- Habitat loss of 10% causes ~1-2% species loss
- But nonlinear (initial habitat loss affects common species less; habitat-specialist species lost first)
- Smaller reserves protect fewer species than larger ones

### Biodiversity Hotspots

Regions with exceptional species concentration + high threat:
- Tropical rainforests: 50% of Earth's species in <10% of land area
- Mediterranean ecosystems: 15% of global plant species in <1% of area
- Coral reefs: 25% of marine species in 0.1% of ocean area

These regions disproportionately important for conservation.

## 5.2 Beta Diversity and Spatial Patterns

### Definition and Measurement

Beta diversity quantifies species turnover between locations. High β-diversity = different species at each site; low β-diversity = repeated species composition.

**Measurement methods:**
1. **Sørensen's coefficient:** Proportional species overlap between sites (0 = no overlap, 1 = complete overlap)
2. **Whittaker's β-diversity:** β = γ/α (regional diversity / average local diversity)
3. **Species turnover rate:** Percent new species encountered moving between sites

### Drivers of Beta Diversity

**1. Environmental heterogeneity:**
Different habitats → Different species

Example: Mountain elevation gradient
- Base: Warm, dry-adapted species
- Mid-elevation: Temperate species
- Summit: Cold, alpine species
- High species turnover with elevation

**2. Dispersal limitation:**
Geographic isolation → Different species (even if habitats similar)

Example: Island biogeography
- Remote islands have endemic species (found nowhere else)
- Nearby islands share more species (dispersal easier)
- Species composition determined by isolation history

**3. Historical contingency:**
Past events determine current composition

Example: Biogeographic regions
- North American and Eurasian mammals differ despite similar climates (once-connected landmass split; subsequent independent evolution created regional faunas)

## 5.3 Ecosystem Services: Human Dependence on Biodiversity

### Definition

**Ecosystem services:** Benefits humans obtain from ecosystems. Often free but not valued until lost.

### Categories

**Provisioning services:** Direct products
- Food (agriculture, fisheries, wild-harvested plants/animals)
- Freshwater (groundwater recharge, water purification)
- Genetic resources (crop/livestock breeding, pharmaceutical compounds)
- Fuel and fiber (wood, crops for energy)

Value: >$10 trillion/year globally

**Regulating services:** Processes maintaining habitability
- Climate regulation (carbon sequestration, albedo effects)
- Water regulation (flood control, streamflow regulation)
- Nutrient cycling (soil nitrogen, phosphorus cycling)
- Pollination (food crop reproduction)
- Pest control (predators suppressing agricultural pests)
- Disease control (natural suppression of disease vectors/pathogens)

Value: Enormous but difficult to quantify; estimates $10-100 trillion/year

**Supporting services:** Underlying ecosystem functions
- Primary production (energy capture)
- Soil formation
- Nutrient cycling
- Habitat provisioning

These underlie provisioning and regulating services.

**Cultural services:** Non-material benefits
- Recreation and ecotourism
- Spiritual and religious values
- Aesthetic values
- Cultural heritage
- Scientific knowledge

Value: Highly variable; often not monetized

### Biodiversity-Ecosystem Service Relationships

**Positive correlation (common):**
More species → More robust ecosystem services. Mechanisms:
- Functional complementarity: Different species use different resources/strategies; collectively exploit environment more completely
- Functional redundancy: Multiple species perform same function; if one species lost, others maintain service
- Insurance effect: Diversity buffers against disturbance (if one species declines, others compensate)

**Exceptions:**
- Single dominant species sometimes provides >90% of service (polyculture not always optimal)
- Invading species sometimes increase service (biological control insects)
- Service-diversity relationships nonlinear (service increases sharply initially with diversity, then plateaus)

### Economic Valuation Challenges

**Approaches:**
1. **Market price:** What do people pay? (limited; only applies to provisioning services with direct markets)
2. **Replacement cost:** How much to replace service artificially? (expensive; e.g., water purification costs $0.1-1 trillion/year if nature stopped providing it)
3. **Contingent valuation:** What would people pay? (asks people hypothetical willingness to pay)
4. **Travel cost method:** Infer value from how far people travel for ecosystem service

**Problems:**
- Vast uncertainty in estimates
- Non-market values difficult to quantify (aesthetic, spiritual values have no market price)
- Future ecosystem services heavily discounted (ecosystems providing services 100 years from now worth near zero in current economic calculations)
- But not quantifying ecosystem services leads to massive undervaluation and destruction

### The Pollination Crisis

Example of critical ecosystem service under threat:

**Importance:** 35% of global food crop production depends on pollinators (mostly insects, some birds, bats)

**Current status:** Pollinator populations declining globally:
- Honeybee colonies collapsing (neonicotinoid pesticides, habitat loss, diseases)
- Native bees declining
- Insect biomass in some regions crashed 75% since 1990

**Consequences:**
- Crop production already impacted (some crops showing fewer seeds/fruits due to pollinator scarcity)
- Economic impact: ~$5-15 billion annually in lost crop value
- Food security threatened (without pollinators, many crops would require manual pollination—economically unsustainable)

# INTEGRATION: APPLIED EXAMPLE - CORAL REEF ECOSYSTEM

### System Overview

Coral reefs simultaneously demonstrate:
- Exceptional biodiversity (25% of marine species in 0.1% of ocean)
- Complex species interactions
- Ecosystem services worth $375 billion/year
- Threatened by human activities

### Energy Flow

```
Zooplankton (Primary consumers)
    ← consumed by ←
Herbivorous fish, corals
    ← consumed by ←
Carnivorous fish, sharks
    ↓
Detritus pathway (dead coral mucus, fish waste)
    → Consumed by detritivores, decomposers
    → Recycled nutrients returned to corals
```

Uniqueness: Coral reefs are productive in nutrient-poor (oligotrophic) water. Secret: Tight nutrient recycling (low loss pathways) and symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) providing photosynthetic energy directly to coral.

### Biodiversity Patterns

- High α-diversity: 400+ coral species, 4000+ fish species in single reef
- High β-diversity: Different coral/fish species at different reef locations (geographic variation)
- High γ-diversity: Enormous global reef species diversity

### Species Interactions

**Symbiosis (mutualism):**
- Coral + zooxanthellae: Mutualism (alga provides photosynthate; coral provides protection)
- Clownfish + sea anemone: Mutualism (clownfish gain protection; anemone gains nutrients/cleaning)

**Predation:**
- Sharks → Fish → Zooplankton → Algae (multiple trophic levels)
- Predators control herbivore populations (preventing algae overconsumption)

**Competition:**
- Corals compete for space (stress of limited real estate)
- Herbivorous fish compete for algae

### Ecosystem Services

- **Provisioning:** Food for 500 million people, genetic resources (20% of pharmaceuticals from reef organisms)
- **Regulating:** Coastal protection (waves buffered by reefs), carbon sequestration
- **Cultural:** Tourism ($30+ billion/year), spiritual value for coastal communities

### Biodiversity Threats

1. **Coral bleaching:** Warming water causes corals to expel zooxanthellae (lose their food source); ~50% of reefs severely bleached by 2023
2. **Overfishing:** Removal of predatory fish and herbivorous fish disrupts food webs; reefs collapse into algae-dominated states
3. **Pollution:** Agricultural runoff eutrophication promotes algae; sediment smothers corals
4. **Acidification:** Lower pH weakens coral skeletons
5. **Physical damage:** Destructive fishing, boating

### Conservation Strategies

- Marine protected areas (no-take zones): Allow predator/herbivore recovery, restore ecosystem function
- Restoration aquaculture: Breeding resistant corals in captivity, transplanting
- Emissions reduction: Climate change underlying cause of bleaching
- Sustainable fishing: Protect herbivorous fish populations (maintain algae control)

## CONCLUSION AND SYNTHESIS

Modern environmental science integrates:
- **Thermodynamics** (energy flow constraints)
- **Biochemistry** (nutrient cycling mechanisms)
- **Population ecology** (growth, competition, predation)
- **Community ecology** (species interactions, organization)
- **Ecosystem ecology** (function, productivity, stability)
- **Conservation biology** (protecting biodiversity, ecosystem services)

Understanding ecosystems requires multiple levels of organization and perspective. Simple models (Lotka-Volterra, logistic growth) provide intuition but must be contextualized within ecosystem complexity.

Current environmental challenges (climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution) result from exceeding Earth's carrying capacity. Solutions require:
- Reducing resource consumption
- Protecting biodiversity and ecosystem services
- Shifting toward circular/regenerative economic models
- Integrating ecological knowledge with social and economic systems
